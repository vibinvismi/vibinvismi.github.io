<p>Today, I am embarking on a journey to learn Go!</p>
<p>Before explaining more about the journey, let me tell you a little bit of background. Recently, I have decided to become more organized in setting learning goals and achieveing them. I have experienced that gentle technology enabled reminders helps a lot to keep focus and avoid distractions. For example, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/watch/close-your-rings/">Activity Rings</a> in Apple Watch. It was an eye-opener that how much it motivates to close those rings and achieve fitness goals every day without fail. I really liked the Activity Rings and searched for similar apps to set personal development goals. At the moment, I am trying out Streaks App, and hope it helps.</p>
<p>One of the goals I have set in Streaks is to learn new languages. Two languages in this case to be exact: One human language and one Programming Language. German is the human language and <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is the Progamming Language I have decided to learn.</p>
<p>Today marks the historical first day in my pursuit of learning Go!</p>
<h2 id="why-go">Why Go?</h2>
<p>I have heard a lot of good things about Go. Even this blog takes advantage of Go in its internal workings. This blog is created in a static site generator and deployed to GitHub Pages. The Static Site Generator in this case is Hugo. You have guessed it correct! Hugo is written in Go.</p>
<p>Go is a newer language and is very quickly rising in popularity.</p>
<p>Go is invented by geniuses in the Computer Science domain and is Open Source.</p>
<p>Go is designed to support concurrency and multicore CPU architecture.</p>
<p>Go is highly performant and is best suited for systems programming.</p>
<p>Above all, it is more human readble and easier to learn.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
