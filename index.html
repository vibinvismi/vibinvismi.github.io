<p>In the world of cloud computing, the concept of serverless computing has gained a lot of attention in recent years. Serverless computing allows developers to focus on writing code instead of managing infrastructure. One of the most popular serverless compute services is AWS Lambda, which is offered by Amazon Web Services.
AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, you simply upload your code and AWS takes care of everything else, including scaling, availability, and security.</p>

<p>I still remember the day when I first started my career as a computer hardware support engineer. It was two decades ago, and technology was quite different back then. The world was not yet fully digital, and the internet was still in its early stages. However, I was determined to make a career out of my love for computers and technology.
As a computer hardware support engineer, my primary role was to provide technical support to users who were experiencing issues with their computer hardware.</p>

<p>The concept of serverless computing has revolutionized the way developers build and deploy applications in the cloud. Serverless computing, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about managing servers or infrastructure. In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll explore what serverless computing is, how it works, its benefits and some of the Serverless services offered by AWS, the most popular Cloud provider.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It’s not my machines, it’s your code!&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;It’s not my code, it’s your machines!&rdquo;
It has been 10 years since John Allspaw and Paul Hammond proposed Dev and Ops co-operation during their talk at the 2009 Velocity Conference. DevOps practise has progressed a long way since then. However, DevOps is just entering mainstream slowly now a days. DevOps practise came into existence as a way to solve never ending fights between Development team and Operations team to enable faster deployments to production.</p>

<p>Data is just like crude. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value.
Clive Humby It has been more than a decade since Clive Humby coined the term &ldquo;Data is the new oil&rdquo;. We now have all the evidence to believe that this is so true.</p>

<p>Today, I am embarking on a journey to learn Go!
Before explaining more about the journey, let me tell you a little bit of background. Recently, I have decided to become more organized in setting learning goals and achieveing them. I have experienced that gentle technology enabled reminders helps a lot to keep focus and avoid distractions. For example, the Activity Rings in Apple Watch. It was an eye-opener that how much it motivates to close those rings and achieve fitness goals every day without fail.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since this blog was updated. Today, I&rsquo;ve decided to bring a new life to my blog with a new backend and a new theme. In the beginning, I had been using Wordpress for blogging but felt like it was overkill for such a simple blog. I was searching for a simpler approach for publishing my blog and thats when I stumbled upon Jekyll. So I decided to try it out.</p>
