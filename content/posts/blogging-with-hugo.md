It's been a while since this blog was updated. Today, I've decided to bring a new life to my blog with a new backend and a new theme. In the beginning, I had been using Wordpress for blogging but felt like it was overkill for such a simple blog. I was searching for a simpler approach for publishing my blog and thats when I stumbled upon Jekyll. So I decided to try it out. However the experience was not ideal for me. 

Then I learned about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and decided to give it a try. My experience with Hugo has been very positive. In comparison to Jekyll and Wordpress, setting up Hugo was a breeze. I was able to install Hugo, set it up and deploy the site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) on my custom domain - all under 30 minutes!
