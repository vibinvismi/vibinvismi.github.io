The concept of serverless computing has revolutionized the way developers build and deploy applications in the cloud. Serverless computing, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about managing servers or infrastructure. In this blog post, we'll explore what serverless computing is, how it works, its benefits and some of the Serverless services offered by AWS, the most popular Cloud provider.

### What is Serverless Computing?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code. With serverless computing, the cloud provider automatically provisions and manages the infrastructure required to run and scale your application. This means that you don't have to worry about server management, capacity planning, or infrastructure scaling.

### How Does Serverless Computing Work?

Serverless computing works by executing code in response to events. An event can be anything that triggers your code to run, such as an HTTP request, a database change, or a file upload. When an event occurs, the cloud provider runs your code in a container and then destroys the container once the code has finished executing. This means that you only pay for the time that your code runs, making serverless computing a cost-effective solution.

### Benefits of Serverless Computing

One of the biggest benefits of serverless computing is scalability. With serverless computing, your application can scale automatically in response to changes in traffic or workload. This means that you don't have to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure or scaling your servers manually.

Another benefit of serverless computing is cost savings. With serverless computing, you only pay for the compute time that your code actually uses. This means that you don't have to pay for idle resources or overprovision your infrastructure to handle spikes in traffic.

Serverless computing also provides faster time to market for your applications. With serverless computing, you can focus on writing code instead of managing infrastructure, which allows you to release new features and updates more quickly.
