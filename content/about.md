Thank you for visiting **Techtalks**.

My name is **Vibin Andrews Kurusingal**. I am an IT Professional and a Hobby Photographer based in Germany.

Currently, my professional focus is at the forefront of **LLM Ops**. I bridge the gap between traditional Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and the unique demands of Large Language Models. I specialize in the operationalization of **Generative AI (GenAI)**—building the robust infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and observability frameworks necessary to move AI from experimental demos to stable, scalable production environments. My goal is to apply the principles of high availability and automation to the evolving world of intelligent systems.

### Aviation & Photography
My passion for aviation has transitioned from the ground to the cockpit. I am currently pursuing my pilot's license, gaining hands-on experience across a diverse range of aircraft, including **gliders, motorgliders, and light motor planes**. I find that the technical precision required to master the distinct **flight characteristics** and **operating disciplines** of these different aircraft perfectly complements the analytical mindset I bring to AI engineering.

When I’m not in the air or at my desk, I spend my time as a **Hobby Photographer**, capturing the world through my lens—with a particular focus on aviation and the unique perspectives found across Germany.
